This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the runtime and package manager for improved performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install Bun if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Note:** This project is configured to use Bun as the runtime. While you can use npm/yarn/pnpm for package management, Bun is the recommended runtime for optimal performance.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start the development server
- `bun run build` - Build the application for production
- `bun run start` - Start the production server
- `bun run lint` - Run ESLint
